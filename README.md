# Beats Color

## Description


This is a simple quick p5 script that display colors ðŸŽ¨ based on the frequency ðŸŽ¶ and intensity ðŸ”Š of the sound recorded from the default microphone ðŸŽ¤. Somewhat like a prototype of the good ol' windows media player

It was made simply to provide a visual ambiance at parties without special devices needed beside a laptop and a videoprojector ðŸ’»ðŸ“½. 


It also was written during those parties so please do not pay attention to the code quality ðŸ˜¶
